            <h1>Early life and background</h1><br><br><br>
            <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in
                Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the
                small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand
                Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.His family
                originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State</p>

            <p>Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay.Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin
                priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London.In
                July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal.His mother was not
                comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle
                Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi
                made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother
                Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him.
                Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing</p>

                <h1>Vegetarianism and committee work</h1><br><br><br>
                <p>Gandhi's time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt
                    "English" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he did not appreciate the bland
                    vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few
                    vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, he joined the London Vegetarian Society,
                    and was elected to its executive committee[44] under the aegis of its president and benefactor
                    Arnold Hills. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater
                    chapter.Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been
                    founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and
                    Hindu literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in
                    translation as well as in the original.</p>

                    <h1>Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)</h1><br><br><br>
                    <p>In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's
                        cousin.He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views,
                        ethics and politics.

                        Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin
                        colour and heritage.He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach
                        and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was
                        kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at
                        Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class.He sat in the train station,
                        shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights.He
                        chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day.In another incident, the
                        magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do.Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a
                        police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.</p>

                        <h1>Europeans, Indians and Africans</h1><br><br><br>
                        <p>Gandhi focused his attention on Indians and Africans while he was in South Africa. He
                            initially was not interested in politics. This changed, however, after he was discriminated
                            against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour
                            by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa,
                            Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights.
                            He entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress.According to Ashwin Desai and
                            Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious in some cases, but that changed
                            afterward.[further explanation needed] Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in
                            South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, and
                            the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a "parasite", "semi-barbarous",
                            "canker", "squalid coolie", "yellow man", and other epithets. People would spit on him as an
                            expression of racial hate.</p>

                            <p>At 5:17 pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla
                                House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse,
                                a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into his chest from a pistol at close
                                range.According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly.In other
                                accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the
                                Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's
                                family members read verses from Hindu scriptures</p>
